        <p>While I'm rather passionate about connecting the dots between various systems, given my current expertise, I also find myself branching out into my hobbies and passions such as Game Development and Modding. It's very much that my free-time is either occupied by whatever interests me in that current time period; whether Graphic Design, Games, or Software.</p>

            <li>
                <h2>Video Games</h2>
                <p>I'm an avid gamer, with a particular interest in strategy games. I pretty much enjoy exploring immersive world-building especially those with complex narratives.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Graphic Design</h2>
                <p>I have a passion for graphic design, often creating digital art and designs in my free time. Mostly uploaded through Instagram where you can see these, otherwise it's primarily just for personal projects.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Game Development and Modding</h2>
                <p>I love creating and modifying games, whether it's through developing my own projects or modding existing games. This allows me to combine my interests in programming, design, and storytelling. I often find myself spending a good chunk of time modding games, especially behemoths like Bethesda Games.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Travel</h2>
                <p>I do enjoy traveling, solo travelling is often my preferred. I find it allows for deeper connections with the places I visit without the hassle of having others control what I want to do.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>East Asian Media</h2>
                <p>I have a big thing on East Asian Media, particularly anime and manga. While I haven't been much of a watcher, I've been a life-long reader instead. Whether it's junk food for the brain or peak literature, it doesn't matter, these mediums often steal so much of my personal time that I forget the concept of time when I get myself too immersed in Japanese Manga, Korean Webtoons, Chinese Manhua, or Light Novels.</p>
            </li>
        </div>
        <p>These are the main interests I would say that mainly define me, but there are certainly others that I haven't mentioned.</p>
